  <h2>Academic Projects-Major</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Clean Street</strong>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> With our project we aim to create a simple and intuitive android application which helps a person to click a photo of garbage and alert sweepers about that garbage. For this, we started by creating the basic
        layout in Android Studio and also functionalities of the application like there are going to be two types of login : User and Sweeper, and based on the type of login the user interface(UI) will be different. For User UI, after login in, the
        user can right away click photo of garbage around him/her and upload the request to remove that garbage. When the photo is clicked, the exact coordinates of the phone’s GPS will also be logged so that exact location of the garbage can be
        shown on the map in Sweeper UI . We are ensuring that the user can only click and upload photo of garbage using a machine learning model which is trained to detect whether there is garbage present or not in the photo. The above mentioned
        machine learning model was trained using Firebase and made available to our Android application through two ways, local and remote. In the Sweeper UI, after login, a minimalistic map showing markers of the location where user has clicked
        photo of garbage is shown. We use Google Map’s API for showing location markers in Sweeper UI and also for clustering functionality. For authentication and data management of user and sweeper we used Firebase as our backend. </p>

    <li><strong>Classify Malware</strong></li>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Whenever a malware affects a system, it makes a series of standard system calls. So, developed a project in which using visualization to see pattern in malware activities can be helpful in the classification of
      the family of malware.</p>
    <li>
      <strong>Auto Spares</strong>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Helped build an inventory management android application using Java, MySQL, etc for a local business, whose inventory includes various parts of trucks and heavy duty vehicles.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Solar Energy Predictor</strong>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Using the weather forecast data for a particular location as an input to predict the solar energy output per unit area of the solar cell using various learning models like linear regression, an artificial neural
        network(ANN), a generalized additive model (GAM), etc.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rent-a-Book</strong>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Using PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, etc. to build a website where a person can rent or buy a book (especially that published by local publishers) from local retail shops. </p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dodge-a-Ball</strong>
    </li>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A game in which a player is running on a ramp and balls are being dropped randomly from the top of the ramp, so the player needs to avoid the ball and continue for as long as possible, this game was built in
      Unreal Engine using C++. </p>
